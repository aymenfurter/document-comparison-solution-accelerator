part of your Microsoft volume licensing agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this SLA will have the meaning assigned to them in the Agreement. This SLA applies to the Microsoft Online Services listed herein (a \u201cService\u201d or the \u201cServices\u201d), but does not apply to separately branded services made available with or connected to the Services or to any on-premise software that is part of any Service.\n If we do not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each Service as described in this SLA, then you may be eligible for a credit towards a portion of your monthly service fees. We will not modify the terms of your SLA during the initial term of your subscription; however, if you renew your subscription, the version of this SLA that is current at the time of renewal will apply throughout your renewal term. We will provide at least 90 days\u2019 notice for adverse material changes to this SLA. You can review the most current version of this SLA at any time by visiting https://aka.ms/CSLA.\n Previews and Online Services and/or service tiers provided free of charge are not included or eligible for SLA claims or credits.\n Prior Versions of this Document\n This SLA provides information on Services currently available. Earlier versions of this document are available at http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com. To find the needed version, a customer may contact its reseller or Microsoft Account Manager.\n Clarifications and Summary of Changes to this Document\n Below are recent additions, deletions and other changes to this SLA. Also listed below, are clarifications of Microsoft policy in response to common customer questions.\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n+---\n   Additions/Updates                   \n+   \n Deletions\n   -----------------------------------\n+---\n  -----------------------------------\n   \n-Microsoft Teams                     \n-  Serv\n+Azure ExpressRoute Traff\n ic\n-e\n  C\n-redits                     \n+ollector   \n   -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Updated definition of \u201cApplicable Monthly Period\u201d to \u201cApplicable Period\u201d as well as updates to associated references.\n+---\n Table of Contents / Definitions\n General Terms\n Definitions\n \u201cApplicable Period\u201d means, for the 30 days prior to and including the last day of the Incident for which a Service Credit is owed, the number of days that you are a subscriber for a Service.\n \u201cApplicable Service Fees\u201d means the total fees actually paid by you for a Service that are applied to the Applicable Period in which a Service Credit is owed.\n \u201cDowntime\u201d is defined for each Service in the Services Specific Terms below. Except for Microsoft Azure Services, Downtime does not include Scheduled Downtime. Downtime does not include unavailability of a Service due to limitations described below and in the Services Specific Terms.\n \u201cError Code\u201d means an indication that an operation has failed, such as an HTTP status code in the 5xx range.\n \u201cExternal Connectivity\u201d is bi-directional network traffic over supported protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS that can be sent and received from a public IP address.\n \u201cIncident\u201d means (i) any single event, or (ii) any set of events, that result in Downtime.\n \u201cManagement Portal\u201d means the web interface, provided by Microsoft, through which customers may manage the Service.\n \u201cScheduled Downtime\u201d means periods of Downtime related to network, hardware, or Service maintenance or upgrades. We will publish notice or notify you at least five (5) days prior to the commencement of such Downtime.\n \u201cService Credit\u201d is the percentage of the Applicable Service Fees credited to you following Microsoft\u2019s claim approval.\n \u201cService Level\u201d means the performance metric(s) set forth in this SLA that Microsoft agrees to meet in the delivery of the Services.\n \u201cService Resource\u201d means an individual resource available for use within a Service.\n \u201cSuccess Code\u201d means an indication that an operation has succeeded, such as an HTTP status code in the 2xx range.\n \u201cSupport Window\u201d refers to the period of time during which a Service feature or compatibility with a separate product or service is supported.\n \u201cUser Minutes\u201d means the total number of minutes in\n+ \n an Applicable Period, less all Scheduled Downtime, multiplied by the total number of users.\n Terms\n Claims\n In order for Microsoft to consider a claim, you must submit the claim to customer support at Microsoft Corporation including all information necessary for Microsoft to validate the claim, including but not limited to: (i) a detailed description of the Incident; (ii) information regarding the time and duration of the Downtime; (iii) the number and location(s) of affected users (if applicable); and (iv) descriptions of your attempts to resolve the Incident at the time of occurrence.\n For a claim related to Microsoft Azure, we must receive the claim within two months of the end of the Applicable Period in which the Incident that is the subject of the claim occurred. For claims related to all other Services, we must receive the claim by the end of the Applicable Period following the month in which the Incident occurred. For example, if the Incident occurred on February 15th, we must receive the claim and all required information by March 31st.\n We will evaluate all information reasonably available to us and make a good faith determination of whether a Service Credit is owed. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process claims during the subsequent month and within forty-five (45) days of receipt. You must be in compliance with the Agreement in order to be eligible for a Service Credit. If we determine that a Service Credit is owed to you, we will apply the Service Credit to your Applicable Service Fees.\n If you purchased more than one Service (not as a suite), then you may submit claims pursuant to the process described above as if each Service were covered by an individual SLA. For example, if you purchased both Exchange Online and SharePoint Online (not as part of a suite), and during the term of the subscription an Incident caused Downtime for both Services, then you could be eligible for two separate Service Credits (one for each Service), by submitting two claims under this SLA. In the event that more than one Service Level for a particular Service is not met because of the same Incident, you must choose only one Service Level under which to make a claim based on the Incident. Unless as otherwise provided in a specific SLA, only one Service Credit is permitted per Service for an Applicable Period.\n Service Credits\n Service Credits are your sole and exclusive remedy for any performance or availability issues for any Service under the Agreement and this SLA. You may not unilaterally offset your Applicable Service Fees for any performance or availability issues.\n Service Credits apply only to fees paid for the particular Service, Service Resource, or Service tier for which a Service Level has not been met. In cases where Service Levels apply to individual Service Resources or to separate Service tiers, Service Credits apply only to fees paid for the affected Service Resource or Service tier, as applicable. The Service Credits awarded in any billing month for a particular Service or Service Resource will not, under any circumstance, exceed your monthly service fees for that Service or Service Resource, as applicable, in the Applicable Period.\n If you purchased Services as part of a suite or other single offer, the Applicable Service Fees and Service Credit for each Service will be pro-rated.\n Services purchased through Reserved Instances or Azure Savings Plans are eligible for Service Credits if the Service has an eligible SLA.\n If you purchased a Service from a reseller, you will receive a service credit directly from your reseller and the reseller will receive a Service Credit directly from us. The Service Credit will be based on the estimated retail price for the applicable Service, as determined by us in our reasonable discretion.\n Limitations\n This SLA and any applicable Service Levels do not apply to any performance or availability issues:\n 1.  Due to factors outside our reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, riots, government action, or a network or device failure external to our data centers, including at your site or between your site and our data center);\n 2.  That result from the use of services, hardware, or software not provided by us, including, but not limited to, issues resulting from inadequate bandwidth or related to third-party software or services;\n 3.  That results from failures in a single Microsoft Datacenter location, when your network connectivity is explicitly dependent on that location in a non-geo-resilient manner;\n 4.  Caused by your use of a Service after we advised you to modify your use of the Service, if you did not modify your use as advised;\n 5.  During or with respect to preview, pre-release, beta or trial versions of a Service, feature or software (as determined by us) or to purchases made using Microsoft subscription credits;\n 6.  That result from your unauthorized action or lack of action when required, or from your employees, agents, contractors, or vendors, or anyone gaining access to our network by means of your passwords or equipment, or otherwise resulting from your failure to follow appropriate security practices;\n 7.  That result from your failure to adhere to any required configurations, use supported platforms, follow any policies for acceptable use, or your use of the Service in a manner inconsistent with the features and functionality of the Service (for example, attempts to perform operations that are not supported) or inconsistent with our published guidance;\n 8.  That result from faulty input, instructions, or arguments (for example, requests to access files that do not exist);\n 9.  That result from your attempts to perform operations that exceed prescribed quotas or that resulted from our throttling of suspected abusive behavior;\n 10. Due to your use of Service features that are outside of associated Support Windows; or\n 11. For licenses reserved, but not paid for, at the time of the Incident.\n 12. Your initiated operations such as restart, stop, start, failover, scale compute, and scale storage that incur downtime are excluded from the uptime calculation.\n 13. Monthly maintenance window that incurs a downtime to patch your server and infrastructure is excluded from the uptime calculation.\n Services purchased through Open, Open Value, and Open Value Subscription volume licensing agreements, and Services in an Office 365 Small Business Premium suite purchased in the form of a product key are not eligible for Service Credits based on service fees. For these Services, any Service Credit that you may be eligible for will be credited in the form of service time (i.e., days) as opposed to service fees, and any references to \u201cApplicable Service Fees\u201d is deleted and replaced by \u201cApplicable Period.\u201d\n Table of Contents / Definitions\n Service Specific Terms\n Microsoft Dynamics 365\n Dynamics 365 Business Central\n Downtime: Any period of time when end users are unable to login to their instance.\n Uptime Percentage: The Uptime Percentage is calculated using the following formula:\n $$\\frac{User\\ Minutes\\  - Downtime\\ }{User\\ Minutes}\\ x\\ 100$$\n where Downtime is measured in user-minutes; that is, for each Applicable Period, Downtime is the sum of the length (in minutes) of each Incident that occurs during that Applicable Period multiplied by the number of users impacted by that Incident.\n Service Credit:\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Uptime Percentage                    Service Credit\n   ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------\n                 < 99.9%                               25%\n                  < 99%                                50%\n                  < 95%                               100%\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n Table of Contents / Definitions\n Dynamics 365 Commerce\n Additional Definitions:\n \u201cActive Tenant\u201d means a tenant with an active high availability production topology in the Management Portal that (A) has been deployed to a Partner Application Service; and (B) has an active database that users can log into.\n \u201cPartner Application Service\u201d means a partner application built on top of and combined with the Platform that (A) is used for processing your organization\u2019s actual business transactions; and (B) has reserve compute and storage resources equal to or greater than one of the Scale Units your partner selected for the applicable partner application.\n \u201cMaximum Available Minutes\u201d means the total accumulated minutes during an Applicable Period in which an Active Tenant was deployed in a Partner Application Service using an active high availability production topology.\n \u201cPlatform\u201d means the Service\u2019s client forms, SQL server reports, batched operations, and API endpoints, or the Service\u2019s retail APIs that are used for commerce or retail purposes only.\n \u201cScale Unit\u201d means the increments by which compute and storage resources are added to or removed from a Partner Application Service.\n \u201cService Infrastructure\u201d means the authentication, computing, and storage resources that Microsoft provides in connection with the Service.\n Downtime: Any period of time when end users are unable to access their Active Tenant, due to a failure in the unexpired Platform or the Service Infrastructure as Microsoft determines from automated health monitoring and system logs.

For example, if an On Demand Capacity Reservation specifies a Capacity of 10 Virtual Machines, then there are 10 Reserved Units.\n \"Unused Capacity Reservation\" is an On Demand Capacity Reservation with the count of Virtual Machines Allocated less than the Capacity.\n \"Not Available for Deployment\" is defined as any Supported Deployment configured to consume an existing Unused Capacity Reservation that meets two conditions:\n i.  Receives an error that specifies lack of Virtual Machine capacity. A Virtual Machine deployment failure for other error types or due to lack of capacity for disks or any other Azure resource does not meet this requirement; and\n ii. On Demand Capacity Reservation continues to meet the definition of Unused Capacity Reservation (e.g., other Virtual Machine(s) did not already consume the Unused Capacity Reservation).\n Uptime Calculation and Service Levels for On Demand Capacity Reservation\n \"Minutes not Available\" is defined as minutes an Unused Capacity Reservation is Not Available for Deployment. From the time a Not Available for Deployment condition occurs, Minutes not Available will accumulate until (a) a subsequent Supported Deployment succeeds, (b) another Not Available for Deployment condition results from another Supported Deployment attempt, or (c) 15 minutes has elapsed. If 15 minutes elapses with no Supported Deployment attempted, then Minutes not Available will resume accumulation upon a subsequent Not Available for Deployment condition.\n The Minutes not Available will accumulate for each Reserved Unit that cannot be used. If one Reserved Unit becomes used while another remains unused, then Minutes not Available will continue to accumulate only for the unused Reserved Unit.\n See example calculation in the feature documentation.\n \"Downtime\" is the total accumulated Minutes not Available that are part of minutes in a given month calculated per Reserved Unit.\n \"Uptime Percentage\" for each Reserved Unit is calculated by the percentage of Minutes in the Applicable Period in which a Reserved Unit had Downtime.\n $$\\frac{\\text{Minutes in an Applicable Period-Downtime}}{\\text{Minutes in an Applicable Period}}\\ x\\ 100$$\n The following Service Levels and Service Credits are applicable to Customer\u2018s use of each Reserved Unit in an On Demand Capacity Reservation.

Must result from a non-purposeful infection.\n     d.  The Virus must have been scanned by the EOP virus filter.\n     e.  If EOP delivers an email that is infected with a known virus to you, EOP will notify you and work with you to identify and remove it. If this results in the prevention of an infection, you won\u2019t be eligible for a Service Credit under the Virus Detection and Blocking Service Level.\n     f.  The Virus Detection and Blocking Service Level shall not apply to:\n         i.  Forms of email abuse not classified as malware, such as spam, phishing and other scams, adware, and forms of spyware, which due to its targeted nature or limited use is not known to the anti-virus community and thus not tracked by anti-virus products as a virus.\n         ii. Corrupt, defective, truncated, or inactive viruses contained in NDRs, notifications, or bounced emails.\n     g.
